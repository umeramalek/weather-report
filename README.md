# weather-report
I created a weather report dashboard using API's. You can search the current weather and a five day forecast of the weather by cities.

* create a repo

3. GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
    input box and search button
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
    usisng api search for current and future predictions
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
    add within js by appending html tags

     UV index by long and latitude
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
